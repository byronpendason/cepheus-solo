Our crew starts out on Atarabete. Each crew member chips in Cr15,000 for the ship's balance. Lets roll for available freight for each neighboring system:

| System   | Starport | Freight | High Passengers | Mid Passengers | Low Passengers |
| :------- | :------- | :-----: | :-------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| Tauradia | D        |   14    |        0        |       1        |       7        |
| Sund     | E        |    5    |        0        |       2        |       0        |
| Sellarne | E        |    5    |        0        |       2        |       1        |
So I guess we're going to Tauradia! We are taking 14 tons of Freight, 1 Mid passenger, and 7 Low passengers. That should be a total of Cr29,000 upon arrival (assuming all 7 low passengers make it).

Law level of 9, and we roll 2D6 trying to get above that to avoid encounters with law enforcement. We roll `[2d6: 8]`, so we fail. Let's roll on the NPC reaction to see what the officer's attitude towards us is. `[d6: 1]`: Hostile. This isn't good. Lady Elizabeth has `Advocate-1` and `Social Standing +1` so we're going to have her deal with the officer.

"Hello, officer," Lady Elizabeth greets the officer as he comes aboard, "What can we do for you?"

"Considering the number of Off-worlders that are trying to smuggle weapons onto our world, we run random cargo searches for contraband. Congratulations, you losers have won the lottery."

> Has our cargo been loaded yet? `No`

"None of our cargo has yet been loaded, but you're free to search our ship," Lady Elizabeth replies.

> Do they find any contraband on board (Unlikely) `No`

After searching the holds and making a mess of the place, Lady Elizabeth is going to make a task resolution roll at Hard (-2 DM) to politely end this encounter. She will use her Social Standing + Advocate (+2 DM), and needs an 8+.  `[2d6: 5] - 2 + 2 = 5` Failure with an effect of 3.

She loses her cool talking to the officer, so the officer takes her into custody to ask her a bunch of questions regarding her ship and her crew. Being innocent though, she is released just in time for take off.

Random encounter for our group (without Lady Elizabeth), needs to be 8+ on 2D6: `[2d6: 7]`. 

Now, we *really* need to hope for a Patron encounter. 9+ 0n 2D6: `[2d6: 8]` Oh well.

What about rumors? 7+ on 2D6: `[2d6: 7]` I will roll on the rumor table in the SRD:  `[d66: 14]` Broad background information. Rolling for some prompts using the Obsidian plugin `Solo RPG Toolkit`, I get the sense that there's rumors of a shadowy organization that's spreading misinformation about the Commonwealth (the interstellar nation that this subsector belongs to). I like the idea of a civil war brewing, so I'm going to say that there's rebels in this subsector (Anytime we encounter pirates, I'll ask the Oracle if they're actually rebels), and this shadowy group is spreading misinformation that's positive towards the rebels and negative towards the Commonwealth. Or so the rumor says, we'll hopefully find out more as the story continues.

It's almost time to leave Atarabete, but first we need to buy fuel (Cr12,000 for 24 tons of ) and life support (Cr2,000 for each stateroom per month, so I'm going to say Cr500 per Stateroom per week, so Cr5,000). Lets also find out who this mid passenger is (we won't worry about the low passengers since they'll be in cryo sleep during the week in jump space). Again, using the `RPG Solo Toolkit`, we get `On Salo`, who is a `Peddler` who has `Good riding skills but bad at unarmed combat`. We will be rolling for events in jumpspace, so that might come into play, but I have no idea.

We leave the planet, and head for the jump point. Random encounter roll: 2D6 + 2 (Starport mod), 8+. `[2d6: 6] + 2 = 8`. Random Encounter: `Alien Starship Crew`. Attitude: `Indifferent`.

Seeing aliens in this subsector is rare, so we hail them: "Greetings, alien starship!"

> Do they respond? `No, and`

They completely ignore us. "Rude," says On Salo.

Stan Wilson plots our course as we are approaching the jump point. 2D6 + Easy 4 + EDU 1 + Nav-1 - 1 Parsec, 8+: `[2d6:10] + 4 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 15`.

Rachel Reid diverts power to the drive. 2d6 + Average 0 + EDU 1 + Engineering-1, 8+: `[2d6: 6] + 0 + 1 + 1 = 8`. Effect is 0, so the piloting won't have any Effect DM.

Lady Elizabeth Brunnel makes the jump. 2D6 + Piloting-2, 8+:  `[2d6: 11] + 2 = 12`. (There was no negative DMs that apply, per "Jump Success Roll, pg 105 of the SRD. If we had gotten between 0-8, it would have been an inaccurate jump, below 0 would have been a misjump.)

Now, lets roll for encounters in Jumpspace, using the charts at https://mytravelleruniverse.com/2017/05/11/random-event-tables-a-week-in-jumpspace/. `[d6: 3]` `One thing - roll once on either table`. I will roll on the first table: `[d66: 64]` `Random cargo container doesnâ€™t appear on the manifest`. So, we have 18 tons of bulk cargo instead of 17. The Starport crew must have accidently gave us an extra ton of cargo. We will deliver it, and I will ask the oracle if we get paid for it. They may insist that we need to take it back, which won't really be a problem since we have nowhere to go from Tauradia except back to Atarabete.

We emerge from jumpspace in Tauradia. Random encounter roll is 2D6 + Starport mod (-1 for D), 8+: `[2d6: 7] - 1 = 6`, no random encounter.

Now we get paid! Cr17,000 for the freight, Cr8,000 for the mid passenger. Lets revive the 7 low passengers. Rachel has Medicine-4 and Edu +1, and the task is Routine (+2), so she'll get a total DM + 7, and needs a 8+. `[2d6: 11] + 7 = 18`, so that's a +2 to each passengers roll, and +2 for being routine. Each will need 8+ to survive.

- `[2d6: 9] + 4 = 13` Success!
- `[2d6: 5] + 4 = 9` Success!
- `[2d6: 9] + 4 = 13` Success!
- `[2d6: 12]` is an automatic success.
- `[2d6: 7] + 4 = 11` Success!
- `[2d6: 10] + 4 = 14` Success!
- `[2d6: 5] + 4 = 9` Success!

So all 7 passengers are revived, adding another Cr7,000 to our revenue. So that's a total of Cr32,000! But subtracting expenses for fuel and life support (-Cr17,000), only gives us a total net of Cr15,000, for a total of $43,000 for the ship. We're losing money, folks, since we started out with Cr45,000!

> Does Tauradia accept delivery of the extra ton of cargo? `Yes, but`

The Starport accepts delivery of the extra cargo, but they're not paying us since they have to pay to ship it back. Bummer. Now lets see what we have to take back:

| Planet        | Freight (tons) | High Passengers | Mid Passengers | Low Passengers |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Atarabete (A) | 100            | 4               | 12             | 48             |
Not bad at all! We can take 85 tons of cargo, and all 4 of the High passengers at single occupancy, and that leaves us 4 rooms for mid passengers. So we'll take 8 mid passengers at double occupancy. So if I'm doing my math right, that should be Cr177,000!

Let's see if we avoid a law encounter, 2D6 and want above the law level. `[2d6: 10]` Awesome!

Random encounter is 8+ on 2D6: `[2d6: 8]` Encounter: Belters, Reaction: Friendly. We encounter some belters who are on vacation. They are very friendly, and we have a few drinks with them.

Patron is 9+ on 2D6. `[2d6: 7]`. No patron, again, but we do have that huge paycheck in the next system, so we'll be okay. What about rumors, 7+ on 2D6? `[2d6: 5]`. Nope.

So we'll head out to the jump point after a boring week at the starport. Random encounter roll to the jumpoint will be 8+ on 2D6 - 2 Starport mod: `[2d6: 10] - 2 = 8`. Encounter: Peasants, Reaction to us: indifferent. We will hail them.

> Do they answer? `No`.

On the way, Stan makes his jump plot, 8+: `[2d6: 6] + 4 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 11`. Success.

Rachel diverts energy to the drives: `[2d6: 5] + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7`, so -1 effect to Lady Elizabeth's pilot roll for her jump.

Lady Elizabeth's roll: `[2d6: 10] + 2 - 1 = 11`. Successful jump!

Encounters in jumpspace: `[d6: 5]`, *Two things - roll once on each table.* First table: `[d66: 52]` *Rescue ball hollowed out, discovered*. Second table: `[d66: 46]` *Best game of something -ever-*.

1st event, I'm gonna assume it means a rescue bubble, which according to Cepheus Engine SRD:

> **Rescue bubble**: A large (2m diameter) pressurized plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space vessels and water craft as emergency lifeboats.

I'm going to ask the oracle some questions:

> Did a stow away get on board using this rescue bubble? No.
> Did someone take one of our rescue bubbles, and strip it of all components? No, but

I'm going to say it was one of our's that came with the ship but was defective. Great, let's hope someone's survival doesn't depend upon us having an extra rescue bubble.

2nd event, one of the passengers organizes a dodgeball tournament. All participants are assigned to 3 person teams (with the 3 members of the crew being a team).

> Does the crew win? No, and

Not only does the crew not win the tournament, but they are eliminated in the first round. But they have the time of their lives, and it was truly the best dodgeball game any of them have ever participated in.

That concludes the first month of this campaign, and a good stopping point for this session.
