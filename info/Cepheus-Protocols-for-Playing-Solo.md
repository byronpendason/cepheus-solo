# Cepheus Engine Procedures For Playing Solo

All page numbers are from *Cepheus Engine SRD*.

This procedure for solo play in Cepheus Engine is intended for a sandbox campaign where the story emerges organically. It assumes that a subsector and characters have already been rolled up and that the characters already have a ship.

## Tables 

### Gamemaster Emulator

D6 | Answer | Alternative Answer
:---:|:---:|:---:
1 | No, and... | Exceptional no
2 | No. | No
3 | No, but... | No
4 | Yes, but... | Yes
5 | Yes. | Yes
6 | Yes, and... | Exceptional Yes 

- If question is likely, roll 2D6 and take the highest result.
- If question is unlikely, roll 2D6 and take the lowest result.
- Every time you roll a 6 on an oracle roll (whether it is used or not, for example when rolling an unlikely oracle roll), roll another D6, and get a plot twist if the result is 1.
- Anytime you start a new scene, roll 2D6. If doubles, it's an altered scene if even or an interrupted scene if odd.
    - Altered Scene: Same as you expect but with an added element. 
    - Interrupted scene: Something totally different than you were expecting.
- If using a GM Emulator (MUNE, CRGE, Mythic, etc), ignore this section.
- *Alternative Answer* column is provided for those who prefer Mythic style answers, though I prefer FU style answers in the middle column.

## Jump into System

 - Random ship encounter from Jump Point to planet, `2D6 + Starport mod`, 8+. Pg 193.

## Landing on planet

- Sell freight and cargo, disembark passengers (i.e., get paid!), refuel, subtract expenses (pg 107).
- Find freight, passengers (pg 110), and/or cargo (ph 116).
- Roll for legal (law level or less on 2D6) and random encounters (8+ on 2D6, pg 186) weekly.
- Roll for Patron encounters (9+ on 2D6, pg 188) and rumors (7+ on 2D6, pg 190) weekly (if on Starport less than a week, roll for each before leaving system).

## Leaving System

- Random ship encounter from planet to Jump Point, `2D6 + Starport mod`, 8+. Pg 193.
- Create a jump plot, `2D6 + 4 (Easy) + EDU - parsecs`, 8+ success. 
- Divert power to engines, `2D6 + 0 (Average) + EDU`, 8+ success, effect is added to jump roll. 
- Jump, piloting check ("Jump Success Roll", pg 105).
