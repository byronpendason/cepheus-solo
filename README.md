Cepheus is a retroclone of the old Traveller TTRPG, which is a sci-fi space opera game. Characters are randomly generated, the subsector is an 8x10 hex map that's also randomly generated, and it uses a `2D6 + Attribute modifier + Skill - Difficulty modifier`, where you're trying to hit 8 or higher to succeed.

I have started an actual play of Cepheus Engine SRD. I'm mostly using the rules as written in the [SRD](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/), but adding procedures as [described here](/info/Cepheus-Protocols-for-Playing-Solo.md).[^1]

[^1]: I am not using the gamemaster emulator used in this document, but I am using everything else.

I have also created a document with info on [my subsector](/info/Subsector.md) that I'm using, and another one with my [ship and crew](/info/Ship%20and%20Crew.md).
